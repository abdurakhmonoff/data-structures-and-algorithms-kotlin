### Dynamic programming definition

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler subproblems and storing the solutions to those subproblems in a table. By solving these subproblems once and reusing their solutions, dynamic programming can dramatically reduce the amount of computation required to solve the original problem.
